    <p>I recently moved from app development at LexisNexis to the DevOps group, officially known as Platform Engineering.</p>

<p>DevOpsy type things is really about the only types of things that I have done in about two years, so the change really makes sense.</p>

<p>The Plaftorm Engineering organization has been doing some work in <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a>, so I thought that I would take a look at the language and see if it’s something worth learning. To make that determination, I figured I would use golang to do something that I have been wanting to do for a while as a personal project: create a command line tool for
this blog.</p>

<p>Why do I need a command line tool for a blog, you say? Well, I don’t really. This blog has never been about what I should do or what I need to do. I mean there are a gazillion (real word) blog platforms and content management systems out there. Did that stop me from writing my own blogging platform from scratch? Nooooooo it didn’t.</p>

<p>So I wrote a command line tool for this blog too. Just for the fun of it and to learn a little bit about golang.</p>

<p>A short overview of how this blog works:</p>

<ol>
<li>I drop a hand coded HTML partial (a new post) into a certain directory and push to an AzureDevOps Git repo.</li>
<li>The commit to the Git master branch triggers the Node app build.</li>
<li>A Docker image is built that contains the new blog post.</li>
<li>The new Docker image for the blog back end is pushed to an Azure image registry.</li>
<li>The final step in the build reloads the container with the latest image on Azure.</li>
<li>A browser gets a request for the Angular.js blog route from the user.</li>
<li>My new post shows up on the blog page at the top.</li>
</ol>

<p>I was driven to create this completely text-based blog, because I wanted complete control of my content, and I had grown tired of maintaing databases and database servers. Schema updates and migrations are for the birds. Yeah, I know. NoSQL. Sure but I didn’t want to have to host that either. So, I came up with the idea to just push the new post to source control, and let the cloud-build take care of the rest. No SQL. No NoSQL. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dln7yj8MDWE">No stinking badges</a>.</p>

<p>So then it became cumbersome to have to hand-code the HTML for the post. I developed a template generator script using Typescript, but I still had to hand-code the inner-HTML. I figured I would start coding my new posts in Markdown, and then have the blog engine convert the Markdown to HTML before sending it over to the browser.</p>

<p>That would have actually have been fairly trivial to implement in the Node backend. But why do it the easy way, when I could learn a whole new language and over-engineer the whole process?</p>

<p>So the <a href="https://github.com/tqheel/bamf">bamf-cli tool</a>, written in golang was born.</p>

<p>Is Go something worth learning? The jury’s still out on that one. I learned a lot, but I could have done the same thing in using Node with Commander, or with C# in a lot less time.</p>

<p>But it was a fun diversion, and now I can write blog posts (like this one), in Markdown and then let Git take the converted file all the way to the cloud in under two minutes.</p>
